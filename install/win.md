The installation on Windows is straightforward, download the installer by

#### Problems you may experience

Because espanso is not digitally signed, you may experience a warning from
Windows Smartscreen. In this case, just click on "More info" (1) and then
on "Run anyway" (2), as shown in the picture:

If you completed the installation procedure, you should have espanso running.
A good way to find out is by going on any text field and typing `:espanso`. 
You should see "Hi there!" appear.
